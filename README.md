# Mini StackOverflow using signalR for real time functionality

The project was built using a Vue SPa template from dotnetcurry to follow the tutorial on mini stackoverflow from donetcurry. Where users can ask question and get updates immediately another user adds a question or vote on that question they are viewing.

The client side code is in the ClientApp folder.
The server side code is in the project.

``dotnet run`` to run from the root directory. It starts the client also as the client is integrated with the server using the .net core SPA template style.
